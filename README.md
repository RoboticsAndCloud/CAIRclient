# CARESSES applications for Nao and Pepper
This repository contains the CARESSES applications, available for the SoftBank robots Pepper and Nao.
To interact with the CARESSES system, open the DialogueManager application folder in Choregraphe, deploy it on the robot and launch it using one of the following trigger sentences:
```
"Let's talk" or "Connect to the Cloud"
```

Once started, the application allows interacting with the CARESSES Cloud. 

To stop the application say:
```
"Stop talking"
```

All the other applications are integrated with the main one and allow the robot to perform extra actions during the conversation. For a better and more complete experience, it is advised to install all the applications on the robot.

For a detailed description of how the system works and what each application does, consult the following Handbook: [CAIR_SW_Handbook.pdf](https://github.com/lucregrassi/CAIRclient/files/7039426/CAIR_SW_Handbook.pdf)
