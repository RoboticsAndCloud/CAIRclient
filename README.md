# CAIR client for SoftBank robots Pepper and Nao
This repository contains the CAIR applications, available for the SoftBank robots Pepper and Nao.
To interact with the CAIR system, open the DialogueManager application folder in Choregraphe, deploy it on the robot and launch it using one of the following trigger sentences:
```
Let's talk"
Talk with me"
```
The chit-chatting behavior of the DialogueManager application can also be launched directly from Choregraphe.

Once started, the application allows interacting with the CAIR Cloud. 

To stop the application say:
```
Stop talking
Quit the application
```

All the other applications are integrated with the main one and allow the robot to perform extra actions during the conversation. For a better and more complete experience, it is advised to install all the applications on the robot.
